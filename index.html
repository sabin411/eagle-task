                    Celsius°CookingTM measures temperatures at the bottom of the connected pots and pans – both when frying, and when simmering delicate sauces that can easily catch or burn – and through a probe that can be put directly into the food. The pot, pan and probe can monitor temperatures in the equipment and the food then communicate with the hob. What this means is that not only can you read the temperature of your food with accuracy, you can also control temperatures and timings to make sure it’s all perfect.
